    <h1>SongWriter Documentation</h1>

    <p>
      The SongWriter application is meant to be an aid in the writing and editing of a simple music lead sheet. As such you might compare it (at least structuarly) to a simple word processor dedicated to one particular type of document, i.e the music lead sheet.

    <div>
      To best understand the SongWriter application we should start with the application toolbar (shown above), which is always present at the top of the application and presents the File, View, Tools and Help top level menu options. If an item is greyed out it means it is currently disabled, for example the Tools menu option shown above.
