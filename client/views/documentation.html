    <h1>SongWriter Documentation</h1>

    <p>
      The SongWriter application is meant to be an aid in the writing and editing of a simple music lead sheet. As such you might compare it (at least structuarly) to a simple word processor dedicated to one particular type of document, i.e the music lead sheet.
		</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
		  The application display consits of three sections, the toolbar, the console and the editor. The console and the editor are not always visible but are displayed based on user action; this action is expressed by use of the toolbar which is always visible at the top of the application display.
    </p>

    <h3>The Toolbar</h3>

    <p>
      The toolbar provides menu selections that enable interaction with the application including the File, View, Tools and Help top-level menu items. To learn more about using the application toolbar please read the "Toolbar Usage" section..
    </p>

    <h3>The Console</h3>

		<p>
      The console appears when a song has been opened or upon starting a new song. It provides two panels, the one on left is for the input form that defnes a song's header, the one on the right is for chord selection.
		</p>

    <h3>The Editor</h3>

		<p>
			The song header form is fairly straight forward, one must enter the required information (marked with a red asterisk) once all the required fields have been entered the song Editor will appear upon leaving the final input field by tabbing or a mouse click. The second panel is for chord selection. To add a chord to a song one must first select a beat within the desired measure (the beat container will highlite to indicate it is waiting for a chord selection) and then select the desired chord from the chord selection panel.

    <div>
      To best understand the SongWriter application we should start with the application toolbar (shown above), which is always present at the top of the application and presents the File, View, Tools and Help top level menu options. If an item is greyed out it means it is currently disabled, for example the Tools menu option shown above.
